# React Native Component Rendering Error: 'Component' is not defined

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes elusive React Native error:  'Component' is not defined.  This often happens due to incorrect imports, typos in component names, or issues with component scope.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where a component is referenced incorrectly, resulting in a runtime error.  The error will manifest as a failure to render the component, with React Native indicating that the component is not defined.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected code. It addresses the issue by ensuring proper component imports and correct usage of the component names within the JSX.
